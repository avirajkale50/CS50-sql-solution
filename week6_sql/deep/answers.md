# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

The reason to adapt the approach is the data get equally distributed all the ships. But there is also some reasons not to the approach is
if I want to retrive the data it will take more time as the data is distributed on all the ships also if there is any technical problem on the
ship we not able to retrive the data.

## Partitioning by Hour
The reason to adapt this approach is my data retrival will be fast beacuse i know which data by time is loacted on which ship and from this I
can retrive data fastly according to the need.But the problem with this approch is the load on the particualr server is more and we need to
scale that server for this tasks and also if data get corrupted we lost the data for that time slot.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

The reason to adapt the approach is the data get equally distributed all the ships and also we can find the data more Quickly as we can
find the hash value for the Timestamp. But there is a reason not to adpat the approach which is if there is any technical problem on the ship
we not able to retrive the data.
